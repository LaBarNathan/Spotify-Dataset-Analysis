# Spotify-Dataset-Analysis

## Overview

This project explores and analyzes Spotify music data to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within audio features and popularity metrics. The goal is to apply data analytics techniques—data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization—to gain insights into what characteristics define popular music on Spotify.

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and was developed as a final project for a data analytics course.

## Project Structure

* `DataAnalyticsFinalProject.ipynb`
  Jupyter/Colab notebook containing all code, analysis, and visualizations.

* `DataAnalyticsPdfSpotify.pdf`
  PDF export of the final project report and results.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of Spotify track-level data, including audio features and metadata such as:

* Track popularity
* Danceability
* Energy
* Tempo
* Loudness
* Valence
* Acousticness
* Artist and track information

The dataset is used strictly for educational and analytical purposes.

## Objectives

* Clean and preprocess Spotify music data
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Visualize relationships between audio features and popularity
* Identify trends in musical characteristics
* Draw data-driven conclusions based on statistical and visual analysis

## Tools and Technologies

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Key Analysis Performed

* Data cleaning and handling missing values
* Summary statistics of audio features
* Correlation analysis between popularity and song attributes
* Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps
* Interpretation of trends and insights from the data

## How to Run

1. Open `DataAnalyticsFinalProject.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2. Ensure required Python libraries are installed
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis

## Results

The project demonstrates how specific audio features relate to song popularity and highlights patterns in modern music trends on Spotify. The findings emphasize the role of energy, danceability, and other measurable features in influencing listener engagement.
